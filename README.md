# Creating a CRUD with React and Bootstrap

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The purpose of this project was to have the first contact with Bootstrap inside a React application. I have been working with Bootstrap before, but only in html files. It turned out to be very similar and simple to manage.
